<p> <font color='#a0dbf9'>Jammu and Kashmir Holiday Planning Guide </font> </p>
<p align='justify'> India's northernmost state, Jammu and Kashmir boasts many notable temples, 
yet the region's claim to fame remains its natural splendor. A tour of Jammu and 
Kashmir takes you across a mountainous landscape at the foothills of the Lesser 
Himalaya, with abundant skiing and hiking opportunities. Despite its natural appeal
 and a wealth of cultural attractions, this border area remains off most tourists' 
 itineraries because of enduring tensions between India and Pakistan. The few foreign
 visitors who make it here usually head to Ladakh, a trekkers' paradise that's also
 considered one of northern India's safest places. </p>
