<p> <font color='#a0dbf9'> <b> Rajasthan Land of Kings </b> </font></p> 
<p align='justify'> One of the jewels in India's crown, Rajasthan is probably at its most appealing when seen from
 the berth of an express train. An epic railway journey across India's largest state reveals 
 sleepy villages frozen in time many centuries ago, ancient fortresses and temples with
 commanding views over the surrounding landscape, and giant cities teeming with life, noise,
 heat, color, and spice. To see as much as you can during your trip to Rajasthan, explore the
 famous Golden Triangle, which includes the cities of Delhi, Jaipur, and Agra, home of the
 Taj Mahal. Other notable destinations worthy of a well-rounded Rajasthan itinerary include 
 Bikaner, famed for its sweets, and Udaipur, known for its lakes and romantic backdrops.
 Rajasthan is in India. </p>




<p><b> Rajasthan Location </b></p>
<p align='justify'> Rajasthan is situated in the north-western part of India. It covers 342,239 square 
kilometres (132,139 square miles). Rajasthan lies between latitudes 23 degree 3'and 30
 degree 12', north and longitudes 69 degree 30' and 78 degree 17', east. Compared to many
 countries that are located in a similar latitudinal belt, such as in northern Arabia, 
 Rajasthan has a less harsh climate. The State's scorching and dry summers and its parched
 landscape is undergoing significant changes because of the developmental effort that have
 led to the spread of the Indira Gandhi Nahar.</p>


<p align='justify'> The southern part of Rajasthan is about 225 km from the Gulf of Kutch and 
about 400 km from the Arabian Sea. Rajasthan is bounded by Pakistan in the west and north-west; 
by the State of Punjab in the north; by Haryana in the north-east; by Uttar Pradesh in the east,
 by Madhya Pradesh in the south-east and Gujarat in the south-west.,</p> 
<p align='justify'> The Aravali mountain ranges that run from Delhi to Gujarat cut through the
 State almost vertically. The Aravali ranges divide the State through south-east and north-west.
 The north-west region covering two-thirds of the state consist mostly of a series of sand dunes.
 Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur and part of the Jhunjhunu districts form part of this region.
 The eastern region has large fertile tracts.</p>



<p> <b>Climate </b></p> 
<p align='justify'> The climate of Rajasthan varies from semi arid to arid. The mercury touches 
49 degrees centigrade at some places during summer and drops below freezing point during winter.

Though the average annual rainfall ranges between 200-400 mm, it is as low as 150 mm in extreme
 arid zones and as high as 1000 mm in the south eastern part of the State. Most of the rainfall
 (60-80%) is received with the South west monsoon in the period from July to September.
 The average number of rainy days vary from 6 to 42 depending on the aridity of the area.</p>
